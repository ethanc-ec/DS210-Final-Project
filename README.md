# DS210-Final-Project

For this final project, I will be using a dataset of twitch users to answer the prompt:
- How often are friends of my friends my friends? This is very generic question, but can you find two vertices who are friends with most similar or most dissimilar sets of connections? What is the right measure of similarity?
